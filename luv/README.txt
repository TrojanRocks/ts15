The following namecases have been used:

1. Classes .oneAbove, and .zeroAbove imply the 1 and 0 that appear above.
2. Classes .oneBelow, and .zeroBelow imply 1 and 0 that are beneath the 1 and 0 mentioned above. These are translated later on.
3. rotateZeroes() was renamed as makeINF(), since the zeroes make the symbol infinity.
4. The js file has been modified accordingly, plus changes have been incorporated for Chrome as well in js and css. (eg -webkit-transform)
5. StellarHS.html was renamed as Stellar TS.html
